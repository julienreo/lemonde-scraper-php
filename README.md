## Personal Project - News website scraper

### Description:

A script is scheduled to parse [Le Monde.fr](http://www.lemonde.fr) news website every hour to scrap its headline content and, in case it has changed, email me with the new headline title, image, legend and article link so that I can access it in case of interest. The objective is to be kept informed on every major news on a daily basis.
